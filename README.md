## About Me

I am a Cloud and DevOps focused engineer currently pursuing a Master's in Web and Data Science in Germany.

My primary interest is building reliable cloud infrastructure, automating deployments, and designing systems that are easy to maintain and scale. I have hands-on experience deploying containerized applications, writing Infrastructure as Code, and implementing CI/CD pipelines.

Most of my backend work is done in TypeScript using NestJS, and several production style projects are available on my GitHub.

## What I Focus On

- Containerized application deployment using Docker  
- Kubernetes based service orchestration  
- CI/CD automation using Jenkins and GitHub Actions  
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform  
- Cloud deployment on GCP and AWS  
- Monitoring and observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch  
- Backend development using TypeScript and NestJS
